# Problem 7.2: Checking for cyclicity
# Given a reference to the head of a singly linked list L, how would you
# determine whether L ends in a null or reaches a cycle of nodes?
# Write a function that returns null if there doesn't exist a cycle, and
# the reference to the start of the cycle is a cycle is present 
# (You do not know the length of the list in advance)
