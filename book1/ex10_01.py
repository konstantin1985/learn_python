# Heap is a complete binary tree
# O(log n) insertions
# O(1) lookup for max element
# O(log n) deletion of max element
# extract-max - delete and return the maximum element

# max-heap implemented as array; children of node at index i are at 2i+1 and 2i+2.
# O(n) searching arbitraty key

# No relationship between the heap data structure and the portion of memory in 
# a process by the same name
