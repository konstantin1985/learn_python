# 10.2 Sort k-increasing array

# An array A of n integers is said to be k-increasing-decreasing if 
# elements repeatedly increase up to certain index after which they 
# decrease, then again increase, a total of k times.

# 57 131 493 294 221 339 418 452 442 190 (4-increasing/decreasing array)

# Problem 10.2: Design an efficient algorithm for sorting a k-increasing-decreasing 
# array. You are given another array of the same size that the result should be
# written to, and you can use O(k) additional storage
