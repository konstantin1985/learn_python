# 13.3 Least Distance sorting

# You come across a collection of 20 stones statues in a line. 
# You want to sort them by height, with the shortest statue on the left.
# The statues are heavy and you want to move them the least possible distance.

# Problem 13.3: Design a sorting algorithm that minimizes the total 
# distance that items are moved
