# USEFUL LINKS

# Class tree links. In "Namespaces: The Whole Story" in Chapter 29 and in 
# "Multiple Inheritance: 'Mix-in' Classes" in Chapter 31, we learned that
# classes have a __bases__ attribute that returns a tuple of their superclass
# objects (the ones listed in parentheses in the class header). 

# Use __bases__ to extend the lister.py mix-in classes we wrote in Chapter 31
# so that they print the names of the immediate superclasses of the instances
# class. 

# When you're done, the first line of the string representation should look
# like this (your address will almost certainly vary):
# <Instance of Sub(Super, Lister), address 7841200:
