# GENERAL INFORMATION:

# In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral
# design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information
# needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
# This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method
# and values for the method parameters.

# What this simply means is that we create a class that contains all the
# logic and the methods required to implement the operation.

# - We don't have to execute a command directly. It can be executed on will.
# - The object that invokes the command is decoupled from the object that
#   knows how to perform it. The invoker does not need to know any 
#   implementation details about the command.
# - If it makes sense, multiple commands can be grouped to allow the invoker
#   to execute them in order. This is useful, for instance, when implementing
#   a multilevel undo command.

# A real-life example:
# When we go to the restaurant for dinner, we give the order to the waiter.
# The check (usually paper) they use to write the order on is an example of
# Command. After writing the order, the waiter places it in the check queue
# that is executed by the cook. Each check is independent and can be used
# to execute many and different commands, for example, one command for each
# item that will be cooked.


print("-" * 20 + "# 1 Use Cases" + "-" * 20)

# - GUI buttons and menu items: The PyQt uses the Command pattern to
#   implement actions on buttons and menu items.

# - Other operations: Apart from undo, Command can be used to implement
#   any operation. A few examples are cut, copy, paste, redo, and capitalize
#   text.

# - Transactional behavior and logging: Transactional behavior and logging
#   are important to keep a persistent log of changes. They are used by
#   operating systems to recover from system crashes, relational databases
#   to implement transactions, filesystems to implement snapshots, and
#   installers (wizards) to revert cancelled installations.

# - Macros: By macros, in this case, we mean a sequence of actions that can be
#   recorded and executed on demand at any point in time. Popular editors such
#   as Emacs and Vim support macros.

print("-" * 20 + "# 2 Implementation" + "-" * 20)

# We will use the Command pattern to implement the most basic file utilities:
# - Creating a file and optionally writing a string in it
# - Reading the contents of a file
# - Renaming a file
# - Deleting a file

# We will not implement these utilities from scratch, since Python already
# offers good implementations of them in the os module. What we want is to
# add an extra abstraction level on top of them so that they can be treated
# as commands. By doing this, we get all the advantages offered by commands.

# Renaming a file and creating a file support undo. Deleting a file and
# reading the contents of a file do no support undo. Undo can actually be
# implemented on delete file operations. One technique is to use a special
# trash/wastebasket directory that stores all the deleted files, so that
# they can be restored when the user requests it. This is the default
# behavior used on all modern desktop environments and is left as an exercise.

# Each command has two parts: the initialization part and the execution part.
# The initialization part is taken care of by the __init__() method and
# contains all the information required by the command to be able to do
# something useful (the path of a file, the contents that will be written to
# the file, and so forth). The execution part is taken care by the execute()
# method. We call the execute() method when we want to actually run a command.
# This is not necessarily right after initializing it.
