# Again, though, for most practical purposes, you can treat True and False as though
# they are predefined variables set to integers 1 and 0.

print(True == 1)       # True, same value
print(True is 1)       # False, but a different object
print(True or False)   # True, same as: 1 or 0
print(True + 4)        # 5, hmmm
